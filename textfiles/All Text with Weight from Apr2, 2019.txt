How close is the scientific community to creating a AI capable of emotions?
 True emotions? Infinitely far away as we have yet to even be able to define what an emotion is in the human animal. Right now the research is on *recognizing* human emotions as input and creating cues we can read on an emotional level as output. But that

How and why was the Turing test discovered so long ago in the past when artificial intelligence was not prevalent?
 The Turing test was not ¡®discovered¡¯. It was devised by Alan Turing when he started thinking about machine intelligence. As he was doing that, it was clear that some method would be needed to decide that a machine was intelligent. An almost obvious answe

How and why was the Turing test discovered so long ago in the past when artificial intelligence was not prevalent?
 Turing was a genius. He also asked, answered, and proved an important question in computer science. The theoretical model for all the computers we use today came from him. You have to learn computer science or computer engineering to understand his geniu
How and why was the Turing test discovered so long ago in the past when artificial intelligence was not prevalent?
 the Turing test was not ¡°discovered¡±, it was created in the 1940s by, well, Alan Turing, a genius mathematician who could see well ahead of his time, and who was a pioneer in the field of AI in a time when eletronic computers did not exist ps. please see
How and why was the Turing test discovered so long ago in the past when artificial intelligence was not prevalent?
 Turing was a genius. He had foreseen the future of intelligent machines - strong AI machines. He had a vision. Albert Einstein never traveled in speeds that are close to the speed of light, he never saw with eyes how great huge mass bends its surrounding

How do we find the right number of layers in the Deep learning Network for a particular problem? Is there any rule or tip that we can use to find the optimal number of layers?
 No. There are no formulas. It depends on your exact problem. You can use what other people who solved similar problems used as guidance but that is it. Start with a small number of everything and gradually increase them until you get a good enough loss r
How do we find the right number of layers in the Deep learning Network for a particular problem? Is there any rule or tip that we can use to find the optimal number of layers?
 One tip to determine the right number of errors is to hold out a cross-validation set (around 20-30% of your data). This way, you can train your model on the training set and then tweak parameters by determining the accuracy in the cross-validation set.

Is it a good idea to remove rows with NA if they are less than 1% of total rows?
 Well, that depends on a lot of things. First, less than 1% of what? That could be 5 rows, 500 rows, 5000 rows, or 5 million. Obviously the bigger that one-percent is in absolute numbers the bigger impact having rows with bad/uninteresting data can have o

Is it a good idea to remove rows with NA if they are less than 1% of total rows?
 Depends.. How big is your data? - Is it 100? Or 10,000 or 10,000,000 rows? Believe me that makes a difference. I would be more inclined to exclude such data if it was 100 rows than 10 mil. Does it make sense that it's NA and not something else? Is it how
Is it a good idea to remove rows with NA if they are less than 1% of total rows?
 If it could be an important feature that can contribute to better accuracy, you should not remove this even if it is 30% missing. More than 30% missing values should be eliminated for sure

How to handle outliers while building linear regression model
 There are two general approaches. The first is to regard outliers as noise in the data. You then choose methods to identify the outliers and give them less weight, alter them, or eliminate them. I prefer to keep outliers just as they are unless there are
How to handle outliers while building linear regression model
 So if there are unexpected outliers, then it means that my assumed data model is wrong. Given that I know my data model is wrong and I am still undertaking linear regression I would infer that I am likely wanting to estimate coefficients rather than buil

 Another way other than what has been mentioned would be to use Logistic regression, to deal with outliers.
How to handle outliers while building linear regression model
 One approach to handle outliers: L1 cost functions handle outliers better than L2 cost functions. L1 norms are resistant to outliers in the data. MAE is L1. MSE is L2. Use Mean Absolute Error.

Why should there be a trade-off between bias and variance in machine learning? Why can't we have the best of both worlds in ML models, meaning low bias and low variance?
 Because so far, no one has come up with a general estimation technique that consistently minimizes both. The ¡°tradeoff¡± isn¡¯t a law of nature, so much as a general description of how estimators tend to behave in the real world. MSE = bias[math]^2[/math]

Why should there be a trade-off between bias and variance in machine learning? Why can't we have the best of both worlds in ML models, meaning low bias and low variance?
 Tradeoff is a manner of speaking. A model wishes to drive bias as low as possible. While doing so, the variance, as a function of complexity grows. To control variance one need to control complexity and the price of controlling complexity is reducing tra
Why should there be a trade-off between bias and variance in machine learning? Why can't we have the best of both worlds in ML models, meaning low bias and low variance?
 You can have low variance and low bias if you collect enough data. But at any given sample size, you have to choose one of them to suffer from. That¡¯s the trade-off.

Is anybody working on a way to replace costly CEOs with AI technology?
 That would be a bad move because AI is logic rules and algorithms, Good CEOs defy logic algorithms and rules to find new ways.
Why is non-linearity fundamental to machine learning? Are there cases where linearity works where non-linearity tends to be used, such as in neural network activation functions?
 Activations functions have to be necessarily non-linear - just a linear combination (weighted sum of inputs) won¡¯t suffice to solve most problems. Take for instance a model with just one input x. Any weighted sum of x, where the weights are parameters of

What safeguards do we have against AI learning to lie, deceive, or withhold valuable information from humans?
 No safeguards, because AI learns mostly by how a human programs it. So a human could program it to answer certain queries with misinformation, also known as a lie. In this case, the AI would be innocent; the lie is to be laid at the feet of the programme
Do you believe that artificial intelligence might leave half of the world unemployed by 2045?

Does the family of GLM models include models with a higher order polynomial term or an interaction term which are technically nonlinear?
 It can. Interaction terms don't make the model nonlinear, though. It's still adding terms together with an intercept (link(y)=intercept+x1+x2+x1*x2). You can transform the predictors individually or as interaction terms. Still a linear regression. I'm no

 If the buck stops with you then you would naturally do the data cleaning yourself or at least supervise the process thoroughly. Basically a 'skin in the game' or ¡®good ego' filled data scientist would leave no stone unturned to develop a good model. The

How can artificial intelligence systems predict the future of chaos?
 It has been proved to be impossible, even though chaos (in its modern meaning) is deterministic. Any finite word size fails to exactly represent the continuous analog values of our reality, and the butterfly effect amplifies even the smallest errors. But
How can artificial intelligence systems predict the future of chaos?
 It can¡¯t. To predict it neds information. The fall of the Soviet Union was not predicted even though all spy organizations were focused on what was going on in USSR. To predict there need to be some sort of information that indicate changes. Without that

Is there any GAN based algorithm that takes two images as input and generates one image? My use case: given faces of parents, we aim to predict the face of their child (using GANs).
 There are Style based GAN¡¯s that utilize Convolutional Layers, yes. I think NVidia released a paper on this, in 2014 - called Style GAN. The general gist of it is applicative to the idea of what you are proposing.There exists coverage of it. What i think

 Some things to think about:
Will training set imbalance still harms the trained deep learning model performance even if the least category has many samples (though not so many as other categories)?
 The annoying thing with imbalance is that it is relative. In one dataset you might have 1000 positive examples and 50 negative. In another you might have 10m positive and 500k negative. These two datasets have the same ratio. I¡¯m sure you will agree that
