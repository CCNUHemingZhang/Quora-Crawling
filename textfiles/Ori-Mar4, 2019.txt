What are the best theme music from a movie or a TV series that will never bore you?
 Here are some of the themes that I could never get tired of listening:
What is a song/movie/TV show that has changed the way you think or see things?
 ¡°The Fault In Our Stars¡± and ¡°Juno.¡± The former is a coming of age, falling in love story amidst a terminal illness; the latter is also a coming of age falling in love story amidst a pregnancy. These kinds of movies where such young characters are facing

What are the most cliche character tropes you¡¯re tired of seeing (movies, books, games, etc.)?
 Any variation on the ¡°chosen one foretold by prophecy to free their land from oppression¡± theme. The mercenary/assassin who hates his job but keeps on (reluctantly?) killing people. They¡¯ll get no sympathy from me. Buddy cop stories pairing the brash you

Does every movie/TV show use ADR? Are all actors required to dub their dialogue in post-production?
 There is no ¡°requirement¡±. The world is not like school where a principal exists who makes rules for you to follow. ADR is the process of rerecording the vocal performance in an audio studio. Generally the video image will be played while the audio engin
Why is Supernatural coming to an end after 15 seasons?
 There are story reasons but it¡¯s most likely business driven. AT&T bought Warner last year. They¡¯re restructuring it this year. They¡¯re launching a WarnerMedia streaming service next year. Right now, the CW shows are more or less bankrolled by Netflix pa

Why is reading considered more intellectual than watching film or TV?
 Partly snobbery: for a very long time, reading was something only the well educated/rich people did. Your average peasant had neither the time nor the money to learn it, and no books to read anyway. So, reading (and owning) books was a way to display you

Which has a better picture quality for watching movies, a monitor or small TV?
 Either work well. High Definition works well on large screens, but on small screens there¡¯s not a huge difference. I even watch on a tablet, shows on Netflix, and considering that¡¯s inches from my face, compared to my 32¡å tv which is 7¨C8 feet away, I don
What effect do you think film and television violence has on people in society?
 I am sure it has a bad effect. In the 1970s there was much less graphic violence on screen. When people fought it was often over quite quickly. Nowadays some screen violence is more brutal and is very detailed and sustained and this must affect people wh
Which live-action television show or movie would you love to watch in a animated version?
 For me, it¡¯s a close tie between two I think would be hysterical in animated form: Impractical Jokers (2011-) A show about four comedic friends, daring each-other to do whatever the other tells them or otherwise suffer the humiliating and/or painful puni

What TV show do you believe has the best ending ever?
 I would say it was Breaking Bad. I expected the last episode to be a train-wreck trying to tie up all the sub-plots but instead was pleasantly surprised by a very satisfying ending. I would say the worst ending was St. Elsewhere. It turned out the show,

Why don't TV manufacturers build TV's with more cinematic 2.35:1 aspect ratios for better home viewing of movies?

What is the best original song for a movie or television series?

Why are all these older TV shows and movies being remade? Can¡¯t anyone come up with any original ideas to put on the screen?
 It¡¯s a nostalgia crisis. People are now, more than ever, able to access the past and tv shows and cinema just happen to be something that grew with us over the past couple of decades. So because it¡¯s such a big part of our daily lives, and it¡¯s even more
What is one thing that sets Breaking Bad apart from other series?
 If I had to say one thing, I would say the gripping plot which never ceases to lose focus or momentum. Also, the incredible depth to each of the characters and their arcs throughout the five seasons hugely contribute to the show¡¯s uniqueness.
How do doctors, lawyers, bankers, police officers, fire fighters, nurses, and soldiers feel about how their profession is portrayed in TV shows and movies?
 Retired LAOD here: TV is fun to warptch, and it is so far divergent from reality that I can enjoy it for the drama. But it in no way is even close to reality. If it were close to reality, I wouldn't be entertained, and neither would you. Spending 12 hour
What show or movie from your youth did you find held up surprisingly well as an adult?
 To Kill a Mockingbird, novel by Harper Lee. Academy award winning movie in 1962. As relevant today as back then. Maybe even more relevant under our current deaf and dumb administration.
Why do James Cameron¡¯s film titles always begin with the letters T or A (Terminator, Avatar, Titanic, Abyss, True Lies, and Aliens)?

What is wrong with Hollywood movies today?
 Too much Flash-Bang along with a healthy dosing of T&A, plot and character development are not being fully realized either. Unfortunately my #1 issue with modern movies is the swearing. We watched a movie called ¡°Colossal¡± that LOOKED like it might be a 
Why do we spend so much time talking about characters in a movie or TV series when they are not even real?
 For the same reason, we are obsessed with the rich and famous. Most of those people aren't real either. The preoccupation with these images is a chance to escape our own reality for a short time. Talking about them and their stories make people feel a pa

Which TV shows are the most realistic in depicting the lives of adults?

What are the best theme music from a movie or a TV series that will never bore you?
 Here are some of the themes that I could never get tired of listening:
What is a song/movie/TV show that has changed the way you think or see things?
 ¡°The Fault In Our Stars¡± and ¡°Juno.¡± The former is a coming of age, falling in love story amidst a terminal illness; the latter is also a coming of age falling in love story amidst a pregnancy. These kinds of movies where such young characters are facing

What are the most cliche character tropes you¡¯re tired of seeing (movies, books, games, etc.)?
 Any variation on the ¡°chosen one foretold by prophecy to free their land from oppression¡± theme. The mercenary/assassin who hates his job but keeps on (reluctantly?) killing people. They¡¯ll get no sympathy from me. Buddy cop stories pairing the brash you

Does every movie/TV show use ADR? Are all actors required to dub their dialogue in post-production?
 There is no ¡°requirement¡±. The world is not like school where a principal exists who makes rules for you to follow. ADR is the process of rerecording the vocal performance in an audio studio. Generally the video image will be played while the audio engin
Why is Supernatural coming to an end after 15 seasons?
 There are story reasons but it¡¯s most likely business driven. AT&T bought Warner last year. They¡¯re restructuring it this year. They¡¯re launching a WarnerMedia streaming service next year. Right now, the CW shows are more or less bankrolled by Netflix pa

Why is reading considered more intellectual than watching film or TV?
 Partly snobbery: for a very long time, reading was something only the well educated/rich people did. Your average peasant had neither the time nor the money to learn it, and no books to read anyway. So, reading (and owning) books was a way to display you

Which has a better picture quality for watching movies, a monitor or small TV?
 Either work well. High Definition works well on large screens, but on small screens there¡¯s not a huge difference. I even watch on a tablet, shows on Netflix, and considering that¡¯s inches from my face, compared to my 32¡å tv which is 7¨C8 feet away, I don
What effect do you think film and television violence has on people in society?
 I am sure it has a bad effect. In the 1970s there was much less graphic violence on screen. When people fought it was often over quite quickly. Nowadays some screen violence is more brutal and is very detailed and sustained and this must affect people wh
Which live-action television show or movie would you love to watch in a animated version?
 For me, it¡¯s a close tie between two I think would be hysterical in animated form: Impractical Jokers (2011-) A show about four comedic friends, daring each-other to do whatever the other tells them or otherwise suffer the humiliating and/or painful puni

What TV show do you believe has the best ending ever?
 I would say it was Breaking Bad. I expected the last episode to be a train-wreck trying to tie up all the sub-plots but instead was pleasantly surprised by a very satisfying ending. I would say the worst ending was St. Elsewhere. It turned out the show,

 Retired LAOD here: TV is fun to warptch, and it is so far divergent from reality that I can enjoy it for the drama. But it in no way is even close to reality. If it were close to reality, I wouldn't be entertained, and neither would you. Spending 12 hour
What show or movie from your youth did you find held up surprisingly well as an adult?
 To Kill a Mockingbird, novel by Harper Lee. Academy award winning movie in 1962. As relevant today as back then. Maybe even more relevant under our current deaf and dumb administration.
Why do James Cameron¡¯s film titles always begin with the letters T or A (Terminator, Avatar, Titanic, Abyss, True Lies, and Aliens)?
